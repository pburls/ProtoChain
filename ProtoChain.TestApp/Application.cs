    /// to which it delegates do:
    /// - <see cref="LocalhostSocketListener"/>: Manages background thread
    ///     for server socket, and additional threads for each socket connection.
    /// - <see cref="QueueingLogWriter"/>: Manages background thread that pulls
    ///     values off a queue and writes them to disk.
    /// - <see cref="StatusReporter"/>: Manages background thread that periodically
    ///     writes status to the console.
    /// 
    /// It is critical that instances of this class are disposed of properly.
